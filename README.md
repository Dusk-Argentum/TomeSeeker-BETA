# Modular Item Homebrew Catalog
Requires Python 3.6.x.

## How to install
To install, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
Once you've done that, you need to set the constants - namely, your
item source, divider, ignored lines, and meta lines. Open `bot.py`
and edit the constants at the top of the file to your desire.

## How to run
To run, run the command `TOKEN=<bot token> python3.6 bot.py`, replacing
\<bot token> with a Discord bot token.
